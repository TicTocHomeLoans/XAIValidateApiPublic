## Getting Started  
  The Xapii by Tiimely API provides a way to seamlessly integrate assessment of financial poistion into your workflow. The table below provides a summary of endpoints, which allow you to get "data in" and then "data out". You can use the [Xapii by Tiimely user interface](https://app.tiimely.com) at any time to interact with your data and the automated assessment of financial position.
  
You'll need the following to start developing:
  - sign-up for Xapii by Tiimely. [Contact us](mailto:contact@tiimley.com) to discuss the right product and access to our `sandbox`
  - your client credentials for the Xapii by Tiimely user interface and API. These will provided to you by Xapii by Tiimely, and must be stored securely
  - you're then ready to start developing against our test environment using the endpoints below. 
  

## Data Model  
  
When you interact with the Xapii by Tiimely user interface and APIs you'll notice there's a clear structure to the data. We've designed the Xapii by Tiimely data model to be optimised for automating assessment of financial position. The data hierarchy is:
  - **application**: this is the structure that holds all other elements and represents a point-in-time product application from your customer
  - **applicants**: an application can have one or more applicants (currently limited to two). Applicants can belong to multiple applications, e.g. a customer applying for a credit card and a home loan would exist in two applications
  - **households**: your applicants belong to households. For convenience we will assign applicants to a single, default household at the start of application
  - **accounts**: applicants own accounts, which can be held individually or jointly with the other  applicant on the application
  - **transactions**: these are the credits and debits against each account. Transactions are enriched with attributes such as categories, high risk flags and expense management. 
  - **documents**: each application and applicant can have a document linked, each with a defined type and format.
